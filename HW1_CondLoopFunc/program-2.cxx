// Description: This program reads a sequence of characters
// from the keyboard and write the characters in reverse order
// to a file as well as to the monitor
//
// Acknowledgement:
// 1. I discussed with Max Goof how to read a character from the keyboard
// and Max Goof showed me how to use operator<<
// 2. I found a program that shows how to write a character to a file at
// www.blah.com/how-to-write-char-to-file.html
// and used it as a reference for my implementation
